This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## About 

**This project was developed to study React.JS and the Material-UI library** 

Nothing better to study a new React.JS library than to recreate the interface of the largest video platform in the world, Youtube.
In addition to the creation of the traditional main page, as a supplement a switch button was introduced in the website header to change the theme to night mode.

This entire project was developed guided by the tutorial from @lucasnhimi on Youtube, to whom I thank the contribution.
