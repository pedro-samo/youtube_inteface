This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## About 

**This project was developed to study React.JS and the Material-UI library** 

Nothing better to study a new React.JS Libary than recreating the interface of the largest video plataform in the world Youtube, adding the Night Mode function at the main page with a switch button located at the top of the page. 

This entire project was developed using the [Lucas Nhimi](https://github.com/lucasnhimi) Tutorial at his Youtube Channel to whom I thank for the knowledge added to my skills.
